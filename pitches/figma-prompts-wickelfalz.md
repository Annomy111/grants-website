## ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

### After Generating All Panels:

1. **Create Assembly Frame:**
```
Create a new frame exactly 632mm wide x 299mm tall (includes 1mm bleed). Name it "Wickelfalz_Assembly_Print".
```

2. **Arrange Panels:**
```
Place panels side by side in correct order. For outside: Back Cover (left), Front Cover (middle), First Flap (right). Create a duplicate frame for inside panels in reverse visual order.
```

3. **Add Fold Indicators:**
```
Add thin red dashed lines at 211mm and 422mm positions to indicate fold lines. These will be removed before final export.
```

4. **Panel Connection Prompt:**
```
Ensure visual continuity between panels. Adjust any elements that should flow across fold lines. Check that text doesn't get cut off at panel edges.
```

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Managing Multiple Panels:
1. Generate each panel in a separate frame first
2. Name frames clearly (e.g., "Panel_1_Solution")
3. Keep a reference image of the fold layout
4. Test the visual flow by arranging thumbnails

### Consistency Across Panels:
- Save color styles after first panel
- Use consistent spacing (20px, 30px, 40px)
- Maintain font hierarchy throughout
- Keep icon sizes uniform

### Common Issues:
- If panels look too different, apply this to each: "Match the visual style of [previous panel], maintaining consistent colors, fonts, and spacing"
- For continuity: "This is panel [X] of a 6-panel brochure about grants for Ukrainian NGOs"

---

## ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE-PROMPT APPROACH

If you want to try generating multiple panels at once:

```
Create a 6-panel brochure layout for a grants database. Panel 1: Blue gradient cover with "Civil Society Grants Database" and €75M+ highlight. Panel 2: Gray contact page with partnership flags. Panel 3: Red problem statement "The Challenge". Panel 4: Green solution overview. Panel 5: Features grid on light background. Panel 6: Metrics and dark CTA section. Each panel should be clearly separated but visually connected. Use Ukrainian blue #0057B7 and yellow #FFD700 as primary colors.
```

*Note: This rarely works well in First Draft, but worth trying if individual panels are too time-consuming.*

*Remember: Wickelfalz folds from right to left, so ensure your content flow makes sense in that order. The front cover is in the middle when unfolded!*
