## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

*"We've built the AI-powered grants platform that's already helping 2,400+ Ukrainian NGOs find €75 million in funding opportunities. In just 3 weeks, we proved we can save organizations 10+ hours per grant search. With your support, we can scale from 500 to 10,000 organizations monthly and expand across CEE. We're seeking €250,000 to transform how civil society accesses recovery funding. Can I show you a 3-minute demo?"*
