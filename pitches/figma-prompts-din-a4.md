## INITIAL DESIGN PROMPT

### Template Selection: Basic Site

**Main Prompt:**
```
Create a single-page promotional landing design for a grants database platform targeting Ukrainian NGOs. The page should have a blue gradient header with white text showing "Civil Society Grants Database" as the main title and "Connecting ‚Ç¨75M+ Funding to Ukrainian Civil Society" as subtitle. Include a German-Ukrainian partnership badge. Below the header, add a bright yellow statistics bar showing three key metrics: "136 Active Grants", "‚Ç¨75M+ Total Funding", and "2,400+ NGOs Served" in large bold numbers. The main content area should have a two-column problem/solution comparison with red accent for problems and green for solutions. Include a 3-column feature grid with icons for "AI Matching", "Bilingual", and "Mobile-First". Add a light blue impact section with 4 metrics in a 2x2 grid. End with a dark footer containing contact information and event details for URC 2025 Booth #42. Use Inter font family throughout. Color scheme: Ukrainian blue #0057B7, yellow #FFD700, success green #00AA44, and dark gray #333333.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If the design looks too "web-like":
- Use this follow-up: "Remove any navigation bars, buttons that look like web links, and browser-specific elements. This is a print flyer, not a website."

### If spacing is off:
- "Increase white space between all sections by 50%. Add clear visual separation between each content block."

### If colors are too light:
- "Make all colors more saturated and print-friendly. Increase contrast between text and backgrounds."

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACH

If First Draft struggles with the single long prompt, break it into sections:

1. **Start with header only**: "Create a header section with blue gradient background..."
2. **Add statistics bar**: "Below the header, add a yellow statistics bar..."
3. **Build incrementally**: Add each section one at a time

This approach gives you more control but takes more steps.

*Note: Figma First Draft works best with web/app layouts. After generation, you'll need to manually adjust for print specifications and export according to FlyerAlarm requirements.*
