### Phase 2: Design Generation

#### For DIN A4 Flyer (30 minutes)

1. **Open First Draft**
   - Press âŒ˜/Ctrl + K
   - Select "First Draft"
   - Choose "Basic Site" template

2. **Generate Base Design**
   - Copy main prompt from `figma-prompts-din-a4.md`
   - Paste and generate
   - Wait for completion (usually 10-20 seconds)

3. **Apply Refinements**
   - Use refinement prompts one by one
   - Allow each to complete before next
   - Check results after each prompt

4. **Manual Adjustments**
   - Fine-tune spacing
   - Verify color accuracy
   - Check text alignment

#### For Multi-Panel Designs (45-60 minutes each)

1. **Generate Each Panel**
   - Create separate frame for each panel
   - Use individual panel prompts
   - Name clearly (e.g., "Wickelfalz_Panel1_Cover")

2. **Maintain Consistency**
   - After first panel, copy color styles
   - Use consistent spacing values
   - Keep font sizes uniform

3. **Assembly Process**
   - Create assembly frame with correct dimensions
   - Copy panels into position
   - Add fold line indicators

### Phase 3: Print Conversion (30 minutes)

#### 1. Dimension Adjustment

**From Digital to Print:**
```
Digital Frame â†’ Print Frame
1. Select frame
2. Change units to mm (Preferences > Units)
3. Set exact dimensions:
   - DIN A4: 210mm x 297mm
   - Wickelfalz: 632mm x 299mm (assembled)
   - Zickzackfalz: 632mm x 212mm (assembled)
4. Add 1mm bleed:
   - Create larger frame behind design
   - Extend backgrounds to bleed edge
   - Keep text within safety margin
```

#### 2. Color Conversion

**RGB to CMYK Preparation:**
```
While Figma uses RGB, prepare for CMYK:

Ukrainian Blue (#0057B7)
â†’ Note: C100 M60 Y0 K10

Ukrainian Yellow (#FFD700)
â†’ Note: C0 M15 Y100 K0

Success Green (#00AA44)
â†’ Note: C80 M0 Y100 K0

Document these for printer reference
```

#### 3. Typography Handling

**Convert Text to Outlines:**
```
1. Select all text layers
2. Right-click â†’ "Outline stroke"
3. Alternative: Export with fonts embedded
4. Verify no text is editable
```

---

### Phase 4: Export Process (20 minutes)

#### Export Settings for FlyerAlarm

1. **Configure Export**
   ```
   Select frame(s)
   Export settings:
   - Format: PDF
   - Include "Bleed"
   - Check "Outline text"
   - No compression
   ```

2. **File Naming**
   ```
   Follow FlyerAlarm convention:
   - URC2025_FlyerA4_EN_Print.pdf
   - URC2025_Wickelfalz_EN_Print.pdf
   - URC2025_Zickzack_EN_Print.pdf
   ```

3. **Resolution Check**
   ```
   For images in design:
   - Right-click image â†’ "Copy as PNG"
   - Check resolution is 300+ DPI
   - Replace low-res images if needed
   ```

## ðŸ”§ TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### Issue: First Draft generates web-style design
**Solution:**
```
Add to prompt: "Remove all web navigation elements, buttons, and links. This is for print, not digital. Use static text and images only."
```

### Issue: Panels don't align properly
**Solution:**
```
1. Use Figma's alignment tools
2. Set up guides at fold points
3. Check with View > Show Rulers
4. Snap to pixel grid OFF for print
```

### Issue: Colors look different than expected
**Solution:**
```
1. Calibrate your monitor
2. Use Figma's color picker precisely
3. Document exact hex values
4. Request printed color proof from FlyerAlarm
```

### Issue: Text too small for print
**Solution:**
```
Minimum sizes for print:
- Body text: 11pt (14px in Figma)
- Captions: 8pt (11px in Figma)
- Fine print: 6pt (8px in Figma)
Multiply Figma px by 0.75 for pt size
```

## ðŸ’¡ PRO TIPS

### Speed Up Your Workflow

1. **Template Your Success**
   - Save first successful panel as component
   - Duplicate and modify for consistency
   - Create "master" color and text styles

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Select multiple similar elements
   - Apply changes simultaneously
   - Use Figma's bulk rename feature

3. **Version Control**
   - Duplicate frames before major changes
   - Name versions clearly (v1, v2, final)
   - Keep "safe" version while experimenting

### Quality Enhancements

1. **Visual Hierarchy**
   ```
   After generation, check:
   - Primary message stands out
   - Clear reading flow
   - Adequate white space
   - Consistent alignment
   ```

2. **Print Optimization**
   ```
   Enhance for print:
   - Increase contrast slightly
   - Avoid pure black text on color
   - Check thin lines (min 0.25pt)
   - Test readability at arm's length
   ```
