## ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS

### Creating the Accordion Layout:

1. **Frame Setup:**
```
Create two frames: "Zickzack_Front" and "Zickzack_Back", each 632mm x 212mm (includes bleed).
```

2. **Panel Arrangement:**
```
Front: Place panels 1-3 side by side, left to right
Back: Place panels 4-6 side by side, left to right (note: these appear in reverse when folded)
```

3. **Fold Indicators:**
```
Add dashed red lines at 211mm and 422mm to show fold positions. Label them "Valley" and "Mountain" folds alternately.
```

4. **Visual Flow Check:**
```
Ensure the story flows logically as panels unfold. Add subtle visual connectors (arrows, continuing patterns) between panels where appropriate.
```

---

## SQUARE FORMAT CONSIDERATIONS

Since each panel is square (210mm x 210mm):

**Adjustment Prompts:**
```
1. "Adjust the layout to be perfectly square, with equal padding on all sides"
2. "Center all elements vertically and horizontally within the square format"
3. "Ensure no content is cut off when cropped to square dimensions"
```

---

## REFINEMENT STRATEGIES

### For Visual Consistency:
```
Apply to each panel: "Match the visual style of [previous panel] while maintaining the square format. Use consistent spacing of 20px between elements and ensure all text sizes match the established hierarchy."
```

### For Print Optimization:
```
"Increase color saturation by 20% for better print reproduction. Ensure all text has sufficient contrast against backgrounds. Make thin lines at least 1pt thick."
```

### For Accordion Flow:
```
"Add a subtle visual element that continues from panel to panel, creating a sense of connection as the brochure unfolds. This could be a gradient that shifts, or a geometric pattern that evolves."
```

---

## COMMON CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

### Challenge: Panels look disconnected
**Solution:** Add this to each panel prompt: "This is panel [X] of a 6-panel accordion brochure that tells the story of transforming grant discovery for Ukrainian NGOs"

### Challenge: Square format issues
**Solution:** "Redesign the layout to work perfectly in a 1:1 square ratio, redistributing elements vertically to fill the space effectively"

### Challenge: Text too small when printed
**Solution:** "Increase all font sizes by 2-4px while maintaining hierarchy. Minimum body text should be 14px"

---

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

### Method 1: Story-First Design
Instead of focusing on layout, emphasize the narrative:
```
"Panel [X] of a grant platform story: [specific content]. Design this as a square card that connects visually to the previous panel about [previous topic]."
```

### Method 2: Template Switching
Try different templates for different effects:
- Panels 1,3,5: Use "Basic App" for modern feel
- Panels 2,4,6: Use "Basic Site" for information-heavy content

### Method 3: Color-Coded Sections
```
"Create panel [X] with [color] as the dominant theme, representing [stage of journey]. Maintain visual consistency with other panels while using color to differentiate sections."
```

## PRO TIPS

1. **Test the Fold:** Print a low-res version and fold it to check flow
2. **Number Panels:** Add tiny numbers during design (remove before print)
3. **Edge Safety:** Keep critical content 5mm from fold lines
4. **Continuity Check:** View all panels together as thumbnails

*Remember: Accordion folds create a dynamic reveal experience. Each panel should entice the reader to unfold the next section!*
