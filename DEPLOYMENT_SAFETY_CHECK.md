# Deployment Safety Checklist

## Pre-Commit Verification ✅

### 1. Netlify Functions Status
- ✅ **auth.js** - Present and working
- ✅ **blog.js** - Present and working  
- ✅ **chat.js** - Present and working
- ✅ **grants.js** - Present and fixed environment variable handling

### 2. Environment Variable Consistency
All functions now use consistent pattern:
```javascript
process.env.SUPABASE_URL || process.env.REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
```

### 3. Critical Files Preserved
- ✅ `client/netlify.toml` - Unchanged, all settings intact
- ✅ `client/netlify/functions/*` - All 4 functions present
- ✅ `client/src/lib/supabase.js` - Supabase client intact
- ✅ All API calls use `/.netlify/functions/` paths

### 4. What We Removed (Safe to Remove)
- ❌ `/server` directory - NOT used in production
- ❌ Admin menu items for Blog Generation and Users - These didn't work anyway
- ❌ Duplicate/redundant scripts - Kept only necessary ones

### 5. Build Configuration
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "build"
  
[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```
✅ Correct and unchanged

### 6. Required Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Netlify dashboard:
- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL`
- `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` (for chat)

### 7. API Routes
All redirects in netlify.toml are preserved:
- `/api/auth/*` → `/.netlify/functions/auth`
- `/api/grants/*` → `/.netlify/functions/grants`
- `/api/chat/grants` → `/.netlify/functions/chat`

### 8. Database Connection
- Supabase client code unchanged
- Service role key used for server-side operations
- Anonymous key used for client-side operations

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying, check:
1. [ ] Homepage loads
2. [ ] Grants page shows data
3. [ ] Chat widget appears and responds
4. [ ] Admin login works at `/admin/login`
5. [ ] Admin can view/edit grants
6. [ ] Admin can manage blog posts
7. [ ] No console errors in browser

## Rollback Plan

If anything breaks:
1. The Express server is archived at `archived/express-server-backup/`
2. Removed admin pages are at `archived/unused-admin-pages/`
3. All changes are in version control

## Summary

✅ **Safe to deploy** - All production functionality preserved
- Netlify Functions: Working
- Supabase connection: Working
- Build process: Unchanged
- Only removed unused code
