- ✅ **100% Complete:** Enhanced fields (program_type, keywords)
- ✅ **94.4% Complete:** Grant amounts
- ❌ **4.7% Complete:** Detailed information (contact_email, application_procedure, required_documents, detailed_description)
- ❌ **0% Complete:** Additional detail fields (contact_phone, contact_person, evaluation_criteria, etc.)

### Data Quality Improvements:
- **Website Links:** 100% of URLs are now clean (prefixes removed)
- **Program Types:** All grants categorized (Fellowship, Project Grant, Innovation Grant, etc.)
- **Keywords:** All grants have searchable keyword arrays
- **Structure:** Database ready for additional detailed information

## Enhancement Priorities

### High Priority (Essential for Users):
1. **Contact Email** - Critical for applications

5. **Contact Phone** - Alternative contact method
6. **Evaluation Criteria** - Helps improve applications

### Low Priority (Nice to Have):
7. **Application Fees** - Budget planning
8. **Reporting Requirements** - Post-award information

## Next Steps Recommendations

### 1. Automated Web Scraping (Short Term)

### 2. Manual Data Entry (Immediate)
- Focus on high-value grants (large amounts, popular organizations)
- Prioritize grants with approaching deadlines
- Add contact information for most frequently accessed grants

### 3. Data Source Integration (Medium Term)
- Connect with grant databases APIs
- Import from government funding portals
- Sync with organization newsletters and announcements
- Set up automated updates for grant information

### 4. Community Contribution (Long Term)
- Allow users to submit missing information
- Implement verification system for user contributions
- Create admin interface for data validation
- Gamify contributions to encourage participation

## Technical Implementation
