ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Netlify Environment Variables Missing!

The blog post has been successfully added to the Supabase database, but it's not showing on the website because the Netlify deployment is missing the required environment variables.

To fix this, you need to add these environment variables in Netlify:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/civil-society-grants-database/settings/env
2. Add these variables:

   SUPABASE_URL=https://adpddtbsstunjotxaldb.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFkcGRkdGJzc3R1bmpvdHhhbGRiIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MDUyNDQyNiwiZXhwIjoyMDU2MTAwNDI2fQ.Kk7UCYqa543oR7W0MRPHqytv8LBhbaq_zaMf32n2ZjM

3. After adding these variables, trigger a redeploy:
   - Go to the "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"

Once the environment variables are added and the site is redeployed, your blog post will be visible at:
https://civil-society-grants-database.netlify.app/blog/ukraine-civil-society-pulse-may-june-2025

The blog post includes all 7 infographics:
âœ… Key Statistics Visualization
âœ… Focus Areas Chart
âœ… Timeline of Events
âœ… Regional Impact Map
âœ… International Support Graph
âœ… Future Priorities Diagram
âœ… Call to Action

Alternative: If you want to see the blog post immediately without waiting for deployment, you can run the site locally with:
cd client && netlify dev
`);
