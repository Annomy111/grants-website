# Deployment Solution Summary

## Root Cause
The "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app" message indicates the React app is loading but failing to initialize, most likely due to missing environment variables.

## Quick Solution

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to your Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Environment variables and add:

```bash
# Required for Supabase connection
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here

# Required for Netlify Functions
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional - to use static data as fallback
REACT_APP_USE_STATIC_DATA=false
```

### 2. Verify Build Settings

In Netlify dashboard → Site settings → Build & deploy:

- **Base directory**: `client`
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `build`
- **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`

### 3. Trigger a New Deploy

After setting environment variables, trigger a new deploy:
- Push a commit to your repository, OR
- In Netlify dashboard, click "Trigger deploy" → "Clear cache and deploy site"

## Testing Your Deployment

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open your deployed site
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for any red error messages in Console tab

2. **Common Error Messages and Fixes**

   **Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createClient')`
   - **Fix**: Set `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

   **Error**: `Network request failed` or CORS errors
   - **Fix**: Ensure all Netlify Functions environment variables are set

   **Error**: 404 on `/api/grants`
   - **Fix**: The app uses `/.netlify/functions/` URLs, not `/api/` - this is correct

## Emergency Fallback Mode

If you need the site working immediately without database:

1. Set in Netlify environment variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_USE_STATIC_DATA=true
   ```

2. Redeploy the site

3. The app will use the JSON files in `/public/data/` instead of Supabase

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] Grants page shows grant listings
- [ ] Language switcher works (EN/UK toggle)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works
- [ ] Chat widget appears in bottom right
- [ ] Admin login page is accessible at `/admin/login`

## Build Logs

The build output should end with:
```
The build folder is ready to be deployed.
```

If you see build errors, they need to be fixed before deployment will work.

## Still Not Working?

1. **Share the browser console errors** - these will pinpoint the exact issue
2. **Check Netlify function logs** - Dashboard → Functions tab → View logs
3. **Verify Supabase is accessible** - Test your Supabase URL in a browser

The app is correctly configured for Netlify deployment. The issue is almost certainly missing environment variables.
