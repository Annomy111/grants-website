# Instructions to Add Your Logo

## IMPORTANT: Manual Step Required

Since I cannot directly save binary image data, you need to manually save your logo image:

1. **Save your logo image** to this location:
   ```
   /Users/winzendwyers/grants website/client/public/images/ukraine-grants-logo.png
   ```

2. The logo should be the image you showed me with:
   - The blue circle with handshake and Ukrainian trident
   - "Ukrainian Civil Society Grants Database" text
   - Blue and yellow Ukrainian flag colors

3. **After saving the image**, the website will automatically use it because I'm updating the code to reference this filename.

## What I'm Doing Now:

I will update the Header.js and Footer.js components to use `/images/ukraine-grants-logo.png` so that once you save your logo there, it will display correctly.

The website will look for your logo at this exact path:
- Full logo: `/images/ukraine-grants-logo.png` (for header)
- Same image will be used in footer but styled smaller

Please save your logo image to the specified location, and it will automatically appear on the website!
