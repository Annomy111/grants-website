# Logo Download Report - Agent 5

## Date: January 5, 2025

## Summary
Due to difficulties accessing official logo resources from organization websites, I have created placeholder SVG logos for all requested organizations. These placeholder logos can be replaced with official versions when they become available.

## Organizations and Status

### 2. Open Government Partnership

- **File**: `/Users/winzendwyers/grants website/client/public/images/logos/open-government-partnership.svg`

- **Format**: SVG

## Technical Issues Encountered
1. Many organization websites returned HTML error pages (403, 404) instead of allowing direct image downloads
2. Some websites have anti-scraping measures that prevented automated downloads
3. Wikipedia Commons did not have logos for these specific organizations
4. Direct URL construction attempts failed due to server-side redirects or access restrictions

## Recommendations
1. Contact organizations directly for official logo files in vector format
2. Check if organizations have media kits or brand guidelines pages with downloadable assets
3. Consider using organization APIs or press resources if available
4. Replace placeholder logos with official versions as they become available

## Files Created
All placeholder logos are created in SVG format with consistent styling:
- Width: 300px
- Height: 100px
- Text-based representation of organization names
- Professional color schemes appropriate for each organization type
