## Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Website Access Issues:**
   - Anna Lindh Foundation: Website returned 503 Service Unavailable
   - BBC Media Action: Domain restrictions prevented automated access

2. **Missing Brand Resources:**
   - Many organizations don't have publicly accessible brand/media pages
   - Logo files often behind login walls or not directly linked

3. **URL Structure Variations:**
   - Standard paths like /logo.png, /media, /brand-assets not consistent across sites
   - Many organizations use custom CMS paths that are difficult to predict

## Recommendations

For the organizations where logos couldn't be found automatically:
1. Manual search on the organizations' official websites using a browser
2. Contact the organizations directly for brand assets
3. Check partner/funder pages where these organizations might be listed
4. Search for annual reports or press releases that might contain logos
5. Use high-quality screenshots from official sources as a last resort

For the remaining organizations, manual intervention is required.
